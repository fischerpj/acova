# Checklist

Here’s a **step‑by‑step diagnostic checklist** you can use when troubleshooting radiator control boards (like the Acova IR IFW case we discussed). It’s designed to help you systematically identify faulty components without replacing parts blindly:

## 🛠 Step‑by‑Step Diagnostic Checklist

### 1. **Visual Inspection**

-   Look for **burn marks, cracks, or bulging capacitors**.

-   Check solder joints for **cold solder or cracks**.

-   Verify connectors and wiring are firmly seated.

### 2. **Power Supply Verification**

-   Measure AC input voltage at the board.

-   Test the **series resistor (R1)** for continuity and correct resistance.

-   Check the **X2 safety capacitor (often 0.47 µF, 275V)** for degradation.

-   Confirm the **bridge rectifier diodes** are not shorted or open.

### 3. **DC Output Check**

-   Measure voltage across the **main electrolytic capacitor (e.g., 25V rated)**.

-   If no voltage is present, suspect the rectifier, zener diode, or switching IC.

-   If voltage is unstable, check capacitors for ESR (equivalent series resistance).

### 4. **Component Testing**

-   **Capacitors:** Replace if bulging, leaking, or showing high ESR.

-   **Resistors:** Verify values with a multimeter.

-   **Relays:** Test coil resistance and switching function.

-   **Zener diode:** Critical for voltage regulation—test with diode mode or replace if suspect.

-   **Switching ICs (power switcher):** Replace if confirmed faulty after other checks.

### 5. **Functional Test**

-   After replacing suspect components, reconnect the board and test under load.

-   Ensure the radiator powers on and responds to controls.

-   Monitor for abnormal heating or repeated failure.

### 6. **Final Verification**

-   Confirm stable operation over several cycles.

-   If the board works after replacing a small component (like the zener diode), note the part reference for future repairs.

-   Document the repair steps for reuse.

## ⚡ Practical Tips

-   Always start with **low‑cost, high‑failure components** (capacitors, resistors, diodes).

-   Use a **multimeter with diode and capacitance modes** for quick checks.

-   Keep spare common parts (X2 capacitors, zener diodes, relays) on hand.

-   Avoid replacing multiple parts at once—test after each change to isolate the root cause.

## AC Voltage

Yes — when I said “measure before and after the fuse or X2 filter capacitor,” I meant **on the alimentation (AC input) side of the board**. Here’s the distinction:

### 🔌 Where to Measure

-   **Alimentation side (AC input):**

    -   This is where mains power (≈230V AC in France) enters the board.

    -   You measure **AC voltage** between **L (live)** and **N (neutral)**.

    -   If the fuse or X2 capacitor is in series with the input, you can check:

        -   **Before the component** → should read full mains voltage.

        -   **After the component** → should also read mains voltage if the part is good.

        -   If voltage drops to 0 after the fuse/capacitor, that component is open/faulty.

-   **Continuity check (power off):**

    -   With the board disconnected from mains, use the multimeter in **ohmmeter mode**.

    -   Test across the fuse or resistor in series with the X2 capacitor.

    -   A good fuse shows near 0 Ω; a blown fuse shows infinite resistance.
