# Knowledge Summary

**Essential Knowledge:** The forum thread explains how to troubleshoot and repair an **Acova IR IFW towel radiator electronic control board**. The key discovery is that the actual fault was a **defective zener diode**, not the relay, capacitor, or resistor initially suspected. Replacing this inexpensive component (\~0.30€) restored the radiator’s functionality.

### 🔑 Core Insights

-   **Problem:**

    -   The radiator’s electronic board stopped receiving power.

    -   Initial replacements included the **relay**, **power switcher**, and **capacitor**, but the issue persisted.

-   **Diagnostic Process:**

    -   Community members suggested checking the **0.47 µF 275V X2 capacitor (C1)** and the **22Ω resistor (R1)** in series.

    -   Measurements showed the resistor was fine, and the capacitor had already been replaced.

    -   Attention turned to the **diode bridge** and the **small electrolytic capacitor (C2, 25V)**.

    -   Voltage testing across C2 was recommended to confirm power regulation.

-   **Resolution:**

    -   The **zener diode** was identified as the defective part.

    -   Once replaced, the radiator worked again.

    -   The user noted they had effectively rebuilt the board, but the fault was only due to this single cheap diode.

-   **Follow-up Discussion:**

    -   Another user (*Blast*) confirmed similar symptoms and asked for the exact zener diode reference, since their component marking was illegible.

    -   They also sought advice on safely removing the board from the casing, which is complicated by the sensor wiring.

### ⚡ Practical Takeaways

-   **Zener diodes** are critical for voltage regulation in these boards.

-   A failed zener can mimic capacitor or resistor faults, leading to unnecessary part replacements.

-   Proper testing (especially voltage across capacitors) helps pinpoint the issue.

-   Even complex electronic failures may boil down to a **single inexpensive component**.
